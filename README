This is a simple project that converts .mov files taken from Quicktime to .gif

To build:

```
$ docker-compose build
```

To run:

* Copy your .mov file to convert/input.mov
* Run this command
```
$ docker-compose up
```
* The output file will be in convert/output/output.gif

To tweak the gif quality change the settings in the ```entrypoint.sh``` and rebuild the project.
